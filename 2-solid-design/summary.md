# SOLID

## Single Responsibilty Principle

- A class should only have one reason to change
- Separation of concerns - different classes hanlding different, independent tasks/problems

## Open-Closed Principle

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle

- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You ain't going to need it

## Dependency Inversion

- High level modules should not depend on low level ones. Use abstractions
